        <p>Hello! My name is Scott Graham, and I am from Orting, Washington. 
         love reading, writing, traveling, spending time with my family, movies, and games. I was born in California, and my family 
        moved to Washington when I was six months old. I am the youngest of five children, and I am close friends with my siblings.
        When I was young, I wanted to become a published author. I used to write books and draw the images for them. I still want to
    become a published author one day, but I also want to work in film production of some sort. One of my greatest passions and hobbies
is all things Disney. I love the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and I love Star Wars as well.</p>
